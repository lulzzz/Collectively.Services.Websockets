**Collectively.Services.Websockets**
----------------

The **Collectively.Services.Websockets** is a service responsible for pushing the real-time notifications e.g. about new or resolved remarks, to the end-users which makes the applications dynamically updatable.  

**Quick start**
----------------

## Docker way

Collectively is built as a set of microservices, therefore the easiest way is to run the whole system using the *docker-compose*.

Clone the [Coolector.Docker](https://github.com/noordwind/Coolector.Docker) repository and run the *start.sh* script:

```
git clone https://github.com/noordwind/Coolector.Docker
./start.sh
```

## Classic way

In order to run the **Collectively.Services.Websockets** you need to have installed:
- [.NET Core](https://dotnet.github.io)
- [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com)

Clone the repository and start the application via *dotnet run --no-restore* command:

```
git clone https://github.com/noordwind/Collectively.Services.Websockets
cd Collectively.Services.Websockets/Collectively.Services.Websockets
dotnet restore --source https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json --source https://www.myget.org/F/coolector/api/v3/index.json --no-cache
dotnet run --no-restore
```

Once executed, you shall be able to access the service at [http://localhost:9050](http://localhost:9050)

Please note that the following solution will only run the Websockets Service which is merely one of the many parts required to run properly the whole Collectively system.

**Configuration**
----------------

Please edit the *appsettings.json* file in order to use the custom application settings. To configure the docker environment update the *dockerfile* - if you would like to change the exposed port, you need to also update it's value that can be found within *Program.cs*.
For the local testing purposes the *.local* or *.docker* configuration files are being used (for both *appsettings* and *dockerfile*), so feel free to create or edit them.

**Tech stack**
----------------
- **[.NET Core](https://dotnet.github.io)** - an open source & cross-platform framework for building applications using C# language.

- **[RawRabbit](https://github.com/pardahlman/RawRabbit)** - an open source library for integration with [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com) service bus.

**Solution structure**
----------------
- **Collectively.Services.Websockets** - core and executable project via *dotnet run --no-restore* command.
